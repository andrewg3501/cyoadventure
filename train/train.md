you guys have decided to take the train and see that the train is one minute way, which is good news. however, you want to go home fast, and it turns out the one minute train was the **local** one.

pretend the R is in the N spot... anyways, the express is another 7 minutes, but your friends insist on taking the local train since it's coming faster, but you know you will get home faster if you take the express despite the fact you have to wait longer
**should you take the express or take the local?**
