you have decided to go meet your friends outside and they tell you to meet them at a pizza place. you guys then have some pizza and want to go somewhere, but can't decide on anywhere and are stuck between the two most voted options, Nintendo World and Dave and Busters. funnily enough, your friends got a tie and it falls to you to decide where to go.
**do you want to go to Nintendo World or go to Dave and Busters?**
